The project was done as a pre-examination requirement in the second year of study.
This is my second dynamic website that I have created.
The site is intended for an online clothing store

The user has the ability to: search, filter and sort products, as well as to: add products to the cart and create an order.

Local storage is used for data storage.
Due to the limitations of the knowledge and technology that I used, the creation of an order by the user is only a simulation, the order data is not processed or stored in the database.
Data about items, categories, brands and discounts are located inside JSON files.
Data is retrieved from JSON files using AJAX.

All HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery code is written from start to finish, no code downloaded from the internet.
The website is adapted for mobile phones and smaller screen resolutions.


On this project I am:
- Improved my knowledge of HTML
- Improved my knowledge of CSS
- Improved my JavaScript knowledge
- Learned JavaScript Library JQuery
- Learned to create JSON objects
- Learned to use AJAX
